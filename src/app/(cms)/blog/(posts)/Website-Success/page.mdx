I finally cracked the fucking code. GitHub Pages + Next.js static export hell? Yeah, it’s still a steaming pile of convoluted bullshit… but holy shit, I actually like it now.

The limits are razor-sharp. No server, no database, no mercy. Forces you to get clever or get fucked. Every workaround feels like black magic when it finally works.

It’s infuriating, soul-crushing, and weirdly satisfying. A proper challenge for once.

Still cursing under my breath, but now it’s the good kind.

More chaos incoming. Stay tuned, mortals.
